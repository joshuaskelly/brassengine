# TODO

## General

- [x] Rename bindings directory to modules.
- [x] Override Lua `io.open()` to sandbox/support zips. [Related SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20715652/how-to-wrap-the-io-functions-in-lua-to-prevent-the-user-from-leaving-x-directory)
- [x] Fix web build. Lua isn't linking?
